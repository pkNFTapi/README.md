# pkNFT
programmable knowledge as private key

The <b>pkNFT</b> project is an innovative NFT platform designed to leverage the power of blockchain technology to manage multiple types of assets, provide secure data storage, and ensure immutable royalty payments to creators. The platform is divided into three main components: pkNFT, NFTapi, and NFroyalT. Each component plays a crucial role in creating a comprehensive and secure NFT ecosystem.
pkNFT

pkNFT stands for "prompt knowledge" as "private key," encapsulating its dual functionality. This component is responsible for managing various types of digital assets, including ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. It ensures secure storage and control over AI prompts and agents within the ecosystem.
Features:

    Asset Management: pkNFT holds and manages multiple types of digital assets, including ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens).
    Prompt and Agent Control: Provides advanced control over the distribution and usage of AI prompts and agents.
    Security: Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure the secure storage and management of assets.

# NFTapi

NFTapi private data storage solution including API keys and login credentials. It ensures that sensitive information is protected and accessible only to the owner(s) as authorized user(s).
Features:

    Secure Storage: Stores API keys, login credentials, and other sensitive data securely.
    Access Control: Ensures that private data is only accessible to authorized entities.
    Integration: Seamlessly integrates with other components of the pkNFT platform to provide a unified experience.

# NFroyalT

NFroyalT addresses the critical need for immutable royalty payment. It incorporates a built-in royalty system within the NFT transfer function ensuring creators receive ongoing compensation from secondary sales.
Features:

    Immutable Royalties: Implements both fixed and percentage-based royalties enforced at the smart contract level.
    Creator Compensation: Ensures creators earn sustainable revenue from the secondary exchange of data.
    Automated Payments: Automates the distribution of royalties to creator as efficient payment process.

How It Works
Holding Multiple Assets

    ERC-20 Tokens: pkNFT can manage and store fungible tokens (ERC-20), which are used for various transactional purposes within the ecosystem.
    ERC-721 Tokens: pkNFT also supports non-fungible tokens (ERC-721), representing unique assets such as digital art, collectibles, and more.

Secure Data Storage with NFTapi

<b>NFTapiT</b> provides a secure repository for storing sensitive information including API keys and login credentials. This component ensures that private data is protected using robust encryption and access control mechanisms.
Immutable Creator Payments with NFroyalT

NFroyalT explores the way creators are compensated by embedding royalty payment rules directly into the smart contract. These rules are immutable and automatically enforce payments to creators whenever an NFT is sold on the secondary market. This system supports both fixed and percentage-based royalties, providing flexibility and fairness to creators.

The pkNFT platform offers a comprehensive solution for managing digital assets, securing private data, and ensuring fair compensation for creators. By integrating multiple EVM Ethereum standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155) and leveraging advanced blockchain features, pkNFT creates a robust and secure ecosystem for NFTs.
